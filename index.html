<!-- Good job on the html! -->
<!-- For the most part, html is intuitive, and uses good semantic classnames -->
<!-- I like the minimal approach to the game as well.  It looks really good! -->
<!-- I would be tempted to put the all the game logic into like a `main` tag that encapsulates all the buttons, etc -->
